# delight.vim

A small simple plugin that toggles `hlsearch` off when you move the your cursor, and back for `n/N`.

## Installation
You can install this plugin using your preferred pack management method. Here is an example of
installation using [minpac](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac)

```vim
call minpac#add('jssee/vim-delight')
```

## Prior art
The idea behind *vim-delight* is not new, it has been living in my dotfiles for some time, and there
are also a few others that do something similar/identical.
